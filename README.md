# Newtonian Collimation Troubleshooting Compendium

A structured, version-controlled troubleshooting guide for common alignment issues in Newtonian telescopes. This compendium is designed for amateur astronomers and telescope enthusiasts who need precise collimation procedures and diagnostic steps.

## Purpose

Collimation is critical for optimal optical performance in Newtonian telescopes. This repository provides detailed, step-by-step guides for diagnosing and correcting common collimation problems, with an emphasis on precision techniques like the barlowed laser method.

## Structure

The compendium is organized as follows:

- **Guides**: Each guide focuses on a specific collimation issue, with theory, symptoms, and detailed correction steps.
- **Tools**: Reference information on collimation tools (e.g., Cheshire, laser collimator, Barlow lens).
- **Contributing**: How to contribute new guides or improvements.

## Table of Contents

- [Barlowed Laser Guide](barlowed-laser-guide.md) – Using a Barlowed laser for precise primary mirror collimation.
- *More guides will be added as issues are addressed.*
